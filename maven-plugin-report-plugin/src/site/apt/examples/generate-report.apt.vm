Configuring Generation of Documentation Reports

 To configure the generation of the documentation reports, add the following to the project's POM:

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-plugin-report-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <reportSets>
          <reportSet>
            <reports>
              <report>report</report>
            </reports>
          </reportSet>
        </reportSets>
      </plugin>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
    ...
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>
+-----+

* Generate Plugin Report without duplicate execution of phase process-classes

 The standard report goal <<<report>>> invokes separate lifecyle of <<<process-classes>>>.
 In a CI environment you now might execute something like <<<mvn clean deploy site-deploy>>>.
 During <<<site>>> build the standard reports will trigger <<<process-classes>>> again, depending on your build this may take some time, because
 stuff like <<<enforcer>>> or generating stubs from a WDSL will be invoked again, which may lead
 to longer build times.

 As of version 3.14.0 a new report goal is defined, <<<report-no-fork>>> which will not trigger above phase a second time.

 Configure this in your <<<reporting>>> section as follows:

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-plugin-report-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <reportSets>
          <reportSet>
            <reports>
              <report>report-no-fork</report>
            </reports>
          </reportSet>
        </reportSets>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>
+-----+

 The documentation is generated by default in <<<$\{project.build.directory\}/site>>>.
