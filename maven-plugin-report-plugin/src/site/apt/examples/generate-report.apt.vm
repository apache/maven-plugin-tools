Configuring Generation of Documentation Reports

 To configure the generation of the documentation reports, add the following to the project's POM:

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-plugin-report-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
    ...
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>
+-----+

 The documentation is generated by default in <<<$\{project.build.directory\}/site>>>.
