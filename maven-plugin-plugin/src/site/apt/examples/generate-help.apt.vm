Configuring Generation of Help Mojo

 To configure the generation of a <<<help>>> mojo, add the following to the project's POM:

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-plugin-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>generated-helpmojo</id>
            <goals>
              <goal>helpmojo</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  ...
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+-----+

 The mojo is generated by default in <<<$\{project.build.directory\}/generated-sources/plugin>>>.
